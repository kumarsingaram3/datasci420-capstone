Capstone - Classifying defective products in the diaper manufacturing process. This project is a part of the Data Science 420 capstone project at the University of Washington.

# Project Description

Generally, to ensure or predict quality, a diaper manufacturer needs to monitor every step of the manufacturing process with sensors such as heat sensors, glue sensors, glue level, etc. To classify defective products in the diaper manufacturing process, we used the SECOM data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contained these sensors. This data set was then joined to a data set of labels, indicating whether a product was defective or not. 

The goal of this project was to go through a real life business case, clean & prepare data, handle class imbalance, and build & test each of the algorithms learned in class.
